#Task

#The National University conducts an examination of  students in  subjects.
#Your task is to compute the average scores of each student.

#Average score = sum of scores obtained in all subjects by a student \ Total number of subjects

#The format for the general mark sheet is:

#Student ID â†’ ___1_____2_____3_____4_____5__               
#Subject 1   |  89    90    78    93    80
#Subject 2   |  90    91    85    88    86  
#Subject 3   |  91    92    83    89    90.5
#            |______________________________
#Average        90    91    82    90    85.5 
#Input Format

#The first line contains N and X separated by a space.
#The next X lines contains the space separated marks obtained by students in a particular subject.

#Constraints

#0 < N <= 100
#0 < X <= 100

#Output Format

#Print the averages of all students on separate lines.

#The averages must be correct up to 1 decimal place.

N, X = map(int,input().split())

l = list()
for _ in range(X):
    l.append(list(map(float, input().split())))
    
print ('\n'.join(map(str,list(map(lambda x: sum(x)/len(x), zip(*l))))))
